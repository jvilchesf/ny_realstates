## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores and visualizes real estate trends in New York City to help building owners, prospective buyers, and other stakeholders understand current market dynamics, regulatory approvals, and construction activities. By leveraging publicly available datasets from NYC Open Data, the analysis sheds light on how economic conditions, city policies, and neighborhood characteristics influence the permitting process and building trends throughout NYC.


## 🎯 Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Explore NYC real estate trends through an intuitive Tableau interface
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Filter by borough, year, job type, building class, and more
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Map-based views of permit approvals across NYC
- **Cost Analysis**: Track construction costs and investment patterns
- **Time Series Trends**: Monitor approval patterns over 2023-2024

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
  - `polars` - High-performance data processing
  - `seaborn` - Statistical data visualization
  - `matplotlib` - Plotting and visualization

- **Visualization Platform**:
  - `Tableau Public` - Interactive dashboard creation

## 📁 Dataset

### Source
- **NYC DOB Job Application Filings Dataset**
- Public dataset from NYC Open Data
- [View Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Job-Application-Filings/ic3t-wcy2/about_data)

### Dataset Characteristics

- **Size**: Thousands of rows with 96 columns
- **Time Period**: Focused on approvals in 2023-2024
- **Key Fields**:
  - `Borough` - NYC borough (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, Staten Island)
  - `Job Type` - Type of job application (new building, alteration, etc.)
  - `Job Status` - Current application status (Approved, Filed, etc.)
  - `Approved` - Date of job application approval
  - `Job #` - Unique identifier for each application
  - `Building Type` - Classification (Residential, Mixed-use, etc.)
  - `Initial Cost` - Estimated project cost
  - `GIS_LATITUDE` / `GIS_LONGITUDE` - Geospatial coordinates
  - `BUILDING_CLASS` - NYC Department of Finance classification code

## 🔄 Data Processing Workflow

### 1. Data Extraction
```python
# Load raw data using polars for efficient processing
df = pl.read_csv('DOB_Job_Application_Filings.csv', 
                 schema_overrides=schema_overrides,
                 ignore_errors=True)
```

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Parse datetime fields
- Handle null values
- Filter by approval years (2023-2024)
- Convert data types for compatibility

### 3. Data Transformation
- Group by key dimensions (Borough, Job Type, Status)
- Aggregate geospatial coordinates (mean latitude/longitude)
- Sum initial costs by category
- Generate clean export for visualization

### 4. Data Export
- Export processed CSV for Tableau ingestion
- Ensure data quality and consistency
